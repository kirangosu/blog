Welcome to my blog.

I am a technology enthusiast. I work towards keeping myself close to any technical developments.

I also read a lot, I write programs almost every day. I do some gardening in my free time.

Whilst, I use this space to share my learnings, please keep a tab on this, if you find this blog interesting.
