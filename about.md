Welcome to my blog. 
I am a technology agnostic software engineer. I work hard to keep myself updated with the latest technology brews. 

In my free time, I learn new programming languages and practice them. I also work on micro electronics in automating tasks at home.

I teach coding to the kids in my local library as part of Coder Dojo.

Gardening is one of my hobbies that keeps me busy most of the summer. I also cook something that's new, well at least new to me and my family. 

I watch cricket and also play for a local club in Essex.

If you like to contact me, please do drop me a note.
