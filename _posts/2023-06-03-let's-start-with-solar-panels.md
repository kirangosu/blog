description: How do we begin with solar panels
---

This is one of my new year resolutions - make a lamp work with a solar panel.

So, for the past few weeks, I was pondering on where to start with. Loads of websites and tonnes of information, each one with varying information. Well everything is right, but not everything works for us. I was a little confused on where to start. So I decided to play safe and begin simple.

I listed down the components required to make a diy project. In short we need just the two things.
- A solar panel.
- An LED or an equivalent load.

So I ordered a solar panel from Ali Express and I got it in 2 weeks. We had an Easter trea at home, consuming 4.5v (3 x 1.5v) batteries. When I checked the voltage from the solar panel, I noticed it was producing over 3.8v, so not bad, isn't it?

I quickly opened up the Easter tree circuit, removed the batteries and connected the Solar Panel leads to the corresponding terminals and voila...

Mission Unlocked. Well not really. If you notice there is no charging module in this entire episode. Yeah, we are not charging batteries, instead we are using the current produced directly from the solar panel. And that means, the LEDs are ON when there is sunlight and OFF when it is most required :)

Technically there is no use, at the moment. So where do I stand now? Yes, exactly at the place where I have to work on building a charging module. Once I build that, you might see a post on it. 

Until then, stay kind and be polite!
