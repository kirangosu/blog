## Enter Electronics

I was three when I could not talk properly. The school denied admission, forcing me to sit at home. In few months from there, I apparently started talking a lot. I always had questions. I remember my parents telling me that I have a mechanical brain - the right word is Engineering brain.

Couple of years later. 

I was 6 years old. My dad, had a book called Transistors - he got that book assuming that it is about Transistor Radio. He thought he'd fix things by reading the book. It didn't help him. It helped me, mmm, not exactly, but I started reading that book.

Couple of years later.

8 years old. The flash torch in our home broke. My dad was sad. But, I was happy, extremly happy. That is because, I now have access to a bulb and three A batteries. All I need now is a wire to connect to see if I can make the bulb glow. Long story short - the bulb was glowing; and I had a wide grin.

Coupld of years later.

10 years old. We started learning Physics, we learnt about electrons, potential difference, magnetic field, electromagnetism. And our physics book had an experiment with step by step procedure to make an electrical door bell. I felt like the world is waiting for me to work on a mission.
