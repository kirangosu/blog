## My Gardening

#### 2020
We moved to where we currently live. Around 3 months before, when we looked into the house, the first thing that struck me is the garden, its vastness, something beyond what I could possibly manage. The house, the built area, on the otherhand was comparably smaller. First thing that came to my mind, upon looking at the garden, was, "ok, lets create a patch for all Indian vegetables this side, and some experiments on the other.

Plans are very easy to be laid, aren't they. But implmenting them is not. Born and spent a considerable time of my younghood in the tropics, I thought gardening is an easy task. Back in Chennai, to grow a tomato, we need to do the following.
- squeeze a tomato in the garden
- forget about it
<few weeks later>
- pick tomatoes.

In the UK, if I do the same thing, the seeds die in the freezing weather. So, what do we do, we look around. I did the same and then noticed that almost every house had a greenhouse. A glass greenhouse is around £400 in the 2020. Will I spend that? No. I purchased one from amazon which is worth £40.

Enter Storm Eunice, I saw the greenhouse flying.

Now, back to 2020.
The £40 greenhouse wasn't that bad to be honest. I used it to store my gardening tools. I did germinated a lot of seeds, but they eventually succumbed to freezxing weather when I took them out.

Nevertheless, I switched to the vegetables that do well in freezing weather. I did grow, potatoes, onions, garlic, beans and strawberries.

But is that all? No, the story is quite big. I will write sometime soon.
