I got a tiny strawberry sapling for Â£2 in April 2021 from a nursey near by. With no prior knowledge on how to grow strawberries, I left the plant, for over couple of weeks, in that tiny pot in which it was sold.

I then learnt that the sapling can be directly planted in the garden under direct sun.

Little did I know that the strawberries can invade the garden then. In 2021, the single plant produced around 7-8 strawberries. But wait for it.

A year later, in 2022, I noticed we had close to 6 plants and it produced, I should say, over 20 strawberries. We were super excited with the yeild. But, yeah, wait for it.

One more year passed. This year, there were at least 20 plants. They all bloomed in mid summer attracting a lot of bees.

Long story short, we got 225g of sweet strawberries this year.

There were so many learnings in the entire process. Since strawberries are invading so much, I might have to move them to a new place next year. And that would be a very long story!
