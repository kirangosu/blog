When I think about it, i's been a decade; yes, time flies soon. I've been into some decent photography a decade ago. And then a lot of things came in. I had to work a little hard to fix my IT profession. 

In that process, I moved across various countries. In the past 10 years, I lived and worked in four different counties. It was only a couple of weeks ago, that I realised that I have ssome time to pursue this hobby of mine. I looked for meetups nearby and to my surprise, I found one nearly close to my place, via the social media.

I pinged them to check if they have availability for me to join them. Long story short, I attended their meetup today. We were around 30 people who attended the meetup today. And to add the cherry on the top, it was the judgement day :-) Well yeah, they had some portrait photography contest and the results were out. Amazing photos from a the lot. 

I believe I'd get to meet them quite often and I'll try to share more updates and photos as we travel in this dimension.
