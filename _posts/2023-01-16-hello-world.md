## Hello World
Well finally this is a start. This, the blog, is one of my new year resolutions in 2023. And here I am. 

A theory, ahem, *wink wink*, says that a quantum of significant magnitude fail to do things, fearing that they'd fail or they can't begin it properly. I firmly believe that there is no perfect beginnings. We all learn as we ... learn. 

An infant learns to talk, learns to walk, learns to eat, learns everything. And if we cerefully look into it, we'd notice that the infant never started anything with perfection. We all learn.

So, here is my blog, perhaps not a great start - but this is a start.

We cease, when we stop learning.

Hello World, welcome to my blog. I'll work hard to keep you engaged.
